    <ol>
        <li>h1 to h6:-Represent six levels of section headings. h1 is the highest section level and h6 is the lowest.</li>
        <li>dl:-Represents a description list. The element encloses a list of groups of terms (specified using the dt element) and descriptions (provided by dd elements). Common uses for this element are to implement a glossary or to display metadata (a list of key-value pairs).</li>
        <li>ol:-Represents an ordered list of items â€” typically rendered as a numbered list.</li>
        <li>p:-Represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields.</li>
        <li>a:-Together with its href attribute, creates a hyperlink to web pages, files, email addresses, locations within the current page, or anything else a URL can address.</li>
        <li>b:-Used to draw the reader's attention to the element's contents, which are not otherwise granted special importance. This was formerly known as the Boldface element, and most browsers still draw the text in boldface. However, you should not use b for styling text or granting importance. If you wish to create boldface text, you should use the CSS font-weight property. If you wish to indicate an element is of special importance, you should use the strong element.</li>
        <li>br:-Produces a line break in text (carriage-return). It is useful for writing a poem or an address, where the division of lines is significant.</li>
        <li>i:-Represents a range of text that is set off from the normal text for some reason, such as idiomatic text, technical terms, and taxonomical designations, among others. Historically, these have been presented using italicized type, which is the original source of the i  naming of this element.</li>
        <li>em:-Marks text that has stress emphasis. The (em) element can be nested, with each nesting level indicating a greater degree of emphasis.</li>
